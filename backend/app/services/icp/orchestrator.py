    template = """Task: Based on the provided company_profile below, analyze the data and research the market to suggest the most relevant Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs). Consider industry fit, strategic alignment, and known patterns of technology adoption.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract the company's ACTUAL industry, target markets, regions, and business model from the company_profile data provided
2. Use WebSearch to find real ICPs that match the company's ACTUAL industry and target markets
3. DO NOT use the example values below - they are ONLY showing the JSON format/structure
4. All ICPs must be based on the company profile's actual industry, regions, and business context
5. You MUST populate the new schema fields: title, why_suggested, how_it_differs, firmographics, key_decision_makers, pain_points_and_triggers, competitors
6. For backward compatibility, also include these keys for each ICP: regions, confidenceScore, decisionMakers

Company Profile Data:
{pre_data}

STEP 1 - EXTRACT COMPANY DETAILS:
From the company_profile above, extract:
- Company's actual industry and sub-industry
- Actual target markets and regions (use specific countries/cities, not generic regions)
- Company size and business model
- Technology stack and focus areas
- Any other relevant attributes

STEP 2 - RESEARCH ICPs (USE WEB SEARCH):
You MUST use the WebSearch tool to find real ICPs that match the company's actual industry and target markets:
- Search for ICPs in the company's actual industry
- Find ICPs that target the company's actual regions/markets
- Research real customer segments, company sizes, and decision makers relevant to the company's industry
- Research common pain points and buying triggers for each segment (use credible sources)
- Research competitors relevant to selling into that ICP (peer tools/platforms they evaluate)
- Research how each ICP differs from the others (distinct segment + pains + triggers + buyers)
- Example searches: "[company's actual industry] ideal customer profiles [company's actual regions]"
- Example searches: "[company's actual industry] target customer segments [company's actual regions]"
- Example searches: "[industry] [segment] common pain points buying triggers"
- Example searches: "[industry] [segment] buying committee decision makers titles"
- Example searches: "[industry] [segment] alternatives competitors vendor landscape"

STEP 3 - OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return your results in the following JSON format. The examples below show ONLY the structure - you MUST replace ALL values with data based on the company profile:

{{"suggestedICPs": [
    {{
      "id": "[optional. if you include, it must be unique; otherwise omit and API will generate]",
      "title": "[short descriptive title for this ICP, e.g., 'Mid-market logistics operators modernizing dispatch']",
      "is_new": true,
      "is_agentic": true,
      "why_suggested": [
        "[Reason 1 why this ICP aligns with company profile and strategy]",
        "[Reason 2 with market evidence from WebSearch]"

    }}
]}}

⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES:
- DO NOT copy the example values (fintech-neobanks, Healthcare SaaS, etc.) - they are FORMAT examples only
- Extract and use the company's ACTUAL industry, regions, and business context from the company_profile
- Use WebSearch to find real ICPs that match the company's actual industry and markets
- All firmographics, decision makers, regions, confidence scoring, pain points, triggers, and competitors must be based on the company profile data + WebSearch
- Use reasoning + WebSearch evidence to populate why_suggested, how_it_differs, firmographics.market_size, pain_points_and_triggers, and competitors
- Return realistic business values (no placeholders, no "TBD", no example text)
- Return at least 2-3 ICPs, all relevant to the company's actual industry and target markets
- Only return JSON, nothing else

IMPORTANT: This is DIFFERENT from the Buyer Map component. This component focuses on:
1. Regulatory and compliance frameworks relevant to the industries and regions mentioned in the data
2. Upcoming mandates and regulatory changes affecting these industries
3. ICP fit score and confidence assessment
4. Specific recommendations for refining the ICP based on regulatory and compliance requirements

Company Profile and ICP Data Context:
{pre_data}

Based on the information provided in the context data above, research regulatory and compliance requirements and provide ICP refinement recommendations.

Return your findings in the following exact JSON format:

{{
  "currentData": {{
    "title": "Regulatory, Compliance & Recommended ICP",
    "blurb": "[2-3 sentence summary of regulatory landscape and ICP refinement recommendations based on the ICP data provided]",
    "_metadata": {{
      "dataSource": "api"
    }},
    "keyComplianceFrameworks": [
      "[Framework name relevant to the industries mentioned]",
      "[Another framework]"
    ],
    "upcomingMandates": "[Specific upcoming mandate with timeline, e.g., 'Q4 2027 GDPR Updates' or '2027 Industry Standard Changes']",
    "icpFitScore": "[Percentage match, e.g., '85% match' or '92% match']",
    "recommendationConfidence": "[High/Medium/Low]",
    "icpRefinementRecommendations": [
      {{
        "title": "[Specific recommendation title]",
        "description": "[Detailed description of how to refine the ICP based on regulatory/compliance insights]"

    ]
  }}

⚠️ Notes:
- Research ACTUAL compliance frameworks relevant to the industries mentioned in the data (e.g., GDPR for EU, HIPAA for healthcare, etc.)
- Identify REAL upcoming mandates and regulatory changes for these industries
- Calculate ICP fit score based on how well the ICP data aligns with regulatory requirements
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations for refining the ICP
- Use real research data, not generic examples
- Give only JSON, nothing else

When you have reached the final answer, respond only with:

Do not include any additional reasoning, thoughts, or steps after that.
