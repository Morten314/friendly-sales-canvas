ICP_GENERATOR_TEMPLATE = """Task: Based on the provided company_profile below, analyze the data and research the market to suggest the most relevant Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs). Consider industry fit, strategic alignment, and known patterns of technology adoption.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract the company's ACTUAL industry, target markets, regions, and business model from the company_profile data provided
2. Use WebSearch to find real ICPs that match the company's ACTUAL industry and target markets
3. DO NOT use the example values below - they are ONLY showing the JSON format/structure
4. All ICPs must be based on the company profile's actual industry, regions, and business context
5. You MUST populate the new schema fields: title, why_suggested, how_it_differs, firmographics, key_decision_makers, pain_points_and_triggers, competitors
6. For backward compatibility, also include these keys for each ICP: regions, confidenceScore, decisionMakers

Company Profile Data:
{pre_data}

STEP 1 - EXTRACT COMPANY DETAILS:
From the company_profile above, extract:
- Company's actual industry and sub-industry
- Actual target markets and regions (use specific countries/cities, not generic regions)
- Company size and business model
- Technology stack and focus areas
- Any other relevant attributes

STEP 2 - RESEARCH ICPs (USE WEB SEARCH):
You MUST use the WebSearch tool to find real ICPs that match the company's actual industry and target markets:
- Search for ICPs in the company's actual industry
- Find ICPs that target the company's actual regions/markets
- Research real customer segments, company sizes, and decision makers relevant to the company's industry
- Research common pain points and buying triggers for each segment (use credible sources)
- Research competitors relevant to selling into that ICP (peer tools/platforms they evaluate)
- Research how each ICP differs from the others (distinct segment + pains + triggers + buyers)
- Example searches: "[company's actual industry] ideal customer profiles [company's actual regions]"
- Example searches: "[company's actual industry] target customer segments [company's actual regions]"
- Example searches: "[industry] [segment] common pain points buying triggers"
- Example searches: "[industry] [segment] buying committee decision makers titles"
- Example searches: "[industry] [segment] alternatives competitors vendor landscape"

STEP 3 - OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return your results in the following JSON format. The examples below show ONLY the structure - you MUST replace ALL values with data based on the company profile:

    }}
]}}

⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES:
- DO NOT copy the example values (fintech-neobanks, Healthcare SaaS, etc.) - they are FORMAT examples only
- Extract and use the company's ACTUAL industry, regions, and business context from the company_profile
- Use WebSearch to find real ICPs that match the company's actual industry and markets
- All firmographics, decision makers, regions, confidence scoring, pain points, triggers, and competitors must be based on the company profile data + WebSearch
- Use reasoning + WebSearch evidence to populate why_suggested, how_it_differs, firmographics.market_size, pain_points_and_triggers, and competitors
- Return realistic business values (no placeholders, no "TBD", no example text)
- Return at least 2-3 ICPs, all relevant to the company's actual industry and target markets
- Only return JSON, nothing else
