# connectors (Apollo discovery)

Owns the Apollo ICP-driven lead discovery frontend: data layer (zod contracts + TanStack Query
hooks against `/connectors/apollo/*`), the Mission Control Data Sources tile + connect modal,
warmup progress + app-wide unlock toast, the discovery flow (re-discovery guard, keep/replace/
download prompt, run + status polling, tile states), and the agent-view lead source filter + badge.

## Public surface (index.ts)

- `ApolloTile` — mounted by mission-control's Data Sources tab.
- `useApolloUnlockToast` — mounted once at the app shell; fires the Locked→Unlocked toast.
- `LEAD_SOURCE_OPTIONS` / `LeadSourceFilter` — for the Scout/Profiler source filter.

## Backend contract

See `plans/35b-apollo-discovery-frontend.md` (contract table). Backend is spec 35a (merged).
